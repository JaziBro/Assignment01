//Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name.//
// Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
//Then print the name after striping the white spaces.//
console.log("\t John \n");
var name2 = "  John  ";
var strippedname = name2.replace(/\s/g, "");
console.log(strippedname);
